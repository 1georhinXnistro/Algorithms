# Catalan Number
In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan (1814–1894)

The number of valid parenthesis expressions that consist of n right parentheses and left parentheses is equal to the nth Catalan number.
