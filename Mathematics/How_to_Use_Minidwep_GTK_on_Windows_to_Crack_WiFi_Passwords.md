In this article, we will show you how to use Minidwep GTK on Windows by following these steps:
 
1. Download and install a VM software, such as VMware or VirtualBox.
2. Download and install a Linux-based OS that contains Minidwep GTK, such as Xiaopan OS[^1^] or Beini.
3. Boot the Linux-based OS from a USB pen drive or in the VM environment.
4. Launch Minidwep GTK from the OS menu or desktop.
5. Select your wireless network card and scan for available Wi-Fi networks.
6. Choose the target Wi-Fi network and start the cracking process.
7. Wait for the password to be displayed in the Minidwep GTK window.

That's it! You have successfully used Minidwep GTK on Windows to crack Wi-Fi passwords. Note that this method is only for educational purposes and you should not use it for illegal or malicious activities. Also, make sure that your wireless network card is compatible with Minidwep GTK and supports monitor mode and injection. Some of the supported cards include RTL8187L, RT3070, AR9271 and many more[^1^].

## What is Minidwep GTK?
 
Minidwep GTK is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Aircrack-ng suite, which is a collection of tools for auditing wireless networks. Minidwep GTK simplifies the process of cracking Wi-Fi passwords by automating the commands and providing a user-friendly interface. It can perform various attacks, such as WEP cracking, WPA/WPA2 cracking, WPS pin cracking and MAC spoofing. It can also capture and analyze network packets, generate fake authentication requests and deauthenticate connected clients.
 
## Why Use Minidwep GTK on Windows?
 
Minidwep GTK is mainly designed for Linux-based OSes, such as Xiaopan OS or Beini. However, some users may prefer to use Windows as their main OS and still want to use Minidwep GTK for wireless security testing. In that case, using a VM environment is a convenient and flexible solution. A VM environment allows you to run multiple OSes on the same machine without affecting each other. You can easily switch between Windows and Linux by using the VM software. You can also save the state of the Linux-based OS and resume it later without rebooting. Moreover, you can use the same wireless network card for both Windows and Linux by using the USB passthrough feature of the VM software.
 
## What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Minidwep GTK?
 
Minidwep GTK has some advantages and disadvantages compared to other wireless security tools. Some of the advantages are:

- It is easy to use and does not require typing Linux commands.
- It supports various wireless network cards and attacks.
- It is free and open source.

Some of the disadvantages are:

- It requires a VM environment and a Linux-based OS to run on Windows.
- It may not work well with some wireless network cards or drivers.
- It may not be updated frequently or have technical support.
